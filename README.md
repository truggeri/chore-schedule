# Chore Schedule

An app for making and keeping a chore schedule.

## About the Application

This app is focused on household chores. Users can create chores, assign them a frequency in days, weeks or months and "perform" them to reset the next due clock. They can assign chores into custom categories as well.

## About Development

This app is being developed using Ruby on Rails. It is very important to note that I am _purposely_ not following many good development practices (tests, services, etc.). This is being done as a benchmark of how fast an app can be created, not because of laziness. If the output of the app is useful, I intend on writing a test suite and refactoring some of the code written.
